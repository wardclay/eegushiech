Recently, another user /u/Stewy___ posted a solid two-line proposal for Japanese TDs (I'd link the post but they seem to have removed it). There were quite a few interesting vehicles, and it was clear that you could come quite close to creating two full TD lines. With some Googling, I managed to complete what Stewy started, and came up with two complete TD lines. I made enough changes to their proposal that I decided this was worth its own post. One line is of casemate One of my all time favorites; Obscure ALternatives.

TL;DR Got screwed out of RWC tickets. Not looking to buy through pricy agency, but will if need be. Anybody know of another opportunity to obtain tickets and just the tickets, not lodging as well? I applied for tickets to the RWC at every possible deadline through the site online. I ended up getting screwed on two of the deadlines due to Japan time change; on the other two deadlines, I simply didn’t win the tickets I applied for. The directions and deadline info in the site are so obscure. This is my favourite album by Japan. Obscure Alternatives is a lesson in laid-back cool and scatter-gun funk which many would love to emulate but will never come close. This is a classic album that really has stood the test of time in spite of it being a very fashion-conscious creation. This is the tight five-piece Japan that featured Rob Dean alongside the more familiar Richard Barbieri, Steve Jansen, Mick Karn & David Sylvian.

Recently I have been having this thought about why people are still buying cars when there are all these alternative means of transportation are becoming a reality. So, in the recent years the car sharing/pool, or rent industry have been constantly growing, and have become quite ubiquitous in many parts of the world. My feeling is that there are less and less motivations to actually choose to purchase a car over these options, and I've read that there are actually some visible effects of these.

Welcome to a primer about early Korean heavy metal  Obviously this only covers South Korean bands, since we can all imagine that there is absolutely no heavy metal from North Korea ( if you really don't believe me, stupid (https://imgur.com/a/jN5Zl) ).
