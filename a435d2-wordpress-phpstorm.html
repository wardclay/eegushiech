I'm fairly new to PHP and started using phpStorm a couple weeks ago. I'm developing a plugin, and went ahead and installed WinNMP (cause i'm on windows), and it works great.

If I install a local DB, Is it possible to get Wordpress up and running in a local phpStorm project with debugging?

I used to code with Sublime Text 3, it's undoubtedly fast but I couldn't manage to get the linters to work properly (spend hours), and the interface is quite bad so I switched to Atom. Atom start-up time is painfully slow but I think I can spare 10 seconds instead of spending hours trying to getting Sublime settings right so it went okay, really like the package manager and the interface. Just recently I realised I'm eligible for PHPStorm (student) license so I took a look. Start-up. I will help you simplify the initial setup process of using PhpStorm with DesktopServer to give you a fast and professional IDE for WordPress development. 
Hello fellow devs! I have a few plugins under my belt, and have been considering my options for alternative programs to write my code. I currently write in Brackets, and while I love the program, I can't help but wonder if a full-blown IDE would be a better option for plugin development. If you have ever said the word PHP on the internet, you're probably getting hammered with PHPStorm ads too. Has anyone taken the time to try it out? What did you think? Do you use a different I've googled this to the point of fatigue. I feel I've seen it all, read it all, tried it all.I'm just trying to learn a usable workflow. I wasn't sure if I should put this here or over at r/phpstorm (https://reddit.com/r/phpstorm) so please delete it if its wrong. I have begun testing PHPstorm for Wordpress theme development. I have gotten the autocompletion to work for the project but to do that I have to add the whole wordpress install folder so there are lots of folders I wont even need but they are project outline still. Is there a way to get the autocompletion without importing the whole install directory - just the theme.

Hi guys I'm trying to start using a proper IDE for my webcoding. I've previously used Brackets and ST3 but I feel like I need something a bit heavier and more evolved. But I'm not sure if I need to use phpstorm or webstorm. I mainly created themes for Wordpress and Drupal. I'm not coding a lot of PHP, but mostly HTML and CSS (ofc. in a php container), but I'm not sure if I need to use phpstorm since both Wordpress and Drupal is PHP based. 
PhpStorm is the best PHP IDE available and you should use it. If you don't agree stop reading. Did you stop reading? No? Good, then you aren't a dumbass let's get started. i'm really new with PHPstorm and IDEs in general. I'm curious if it's possible to setup a full wordpress deployment (database and all) from my local dev environmnet to a live site? Currently I use a backup plugin to migrate from local to live but I'd love a more streamlined approach. Configure a local environment for building a WordPress plugin or theme using JetBrains PhpStorm. With the latest version of PHPstorm having Wordpress integration, I thought I would ask how people have liked using it for that. Do you have any tips for using Wordpress with PHPstorm?

I've tried Aptana Studio, and I more or less like it, but I understand that PhpStorm now has some direct WordPress support so I'd like to give it a go. With Aptana, it was pretty easy to designate a local.

So I'm new at WordPress development and I'm wondering what the best approach is to debug a plugin in WordPress. I've got PHPStorm set up, together with a local test site.

This week has nearly been too much for me. I do Software Engineering as my job at a very small company which is just me and my boss. Large part of our income is eBooks, which is just HTML/CSS, but a bigger part is the "web development" - Websites for people, making plugins for them, etc. Now onto the problem. The current workflow is to create a folder on a shared drive, and just shove everything there, expecting me to document all changes I make, how long I spend on it, etc. There While working with WordPress after a while, the first problem I encountered is that I can't debug it easily as I could do it directly from PyCharm (for python/django), RubyMine (for ruby/rails). This is a bit more of a rant, but would like you opinions. I‚Äôve been contemplating leaving my current dev job and looking for another to advance my growth as a developer. I‚Äôve been at my current company for almost four years now. It‚Äôs my first software developer job directly out of college, before this job, I wrote PHP for a small shop that gave clients WordPress site and small other web apps, but that‚Äôs another messy story for another day. Although, I have learned allot and have gain allot.
